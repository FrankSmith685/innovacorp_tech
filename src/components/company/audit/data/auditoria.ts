export const auditoriaIntro = `We identify biases and remove obstacles in the recruitment process.
Recruitment processes have evolved over time, introducing new systems, content, or technologies. While these processes offer functionality and expertise in talent selection, biases are likely to exist at every stage.
Our inclusion audit analyzes every touchpoint with the candidate throughout the recruitment process â€” from the job description for the position, through your internal talent area, the application process, interview, and selection, to onboarding.
This approach provides ongoing transparency regarding both active and hidden barriers and biases.`;
