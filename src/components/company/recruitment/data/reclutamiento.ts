export const reclutamientoIntro = `We commit to every recruitment process as if it were our own company, focusing on people and truly listening to themâ€”whether they are candidates or clients. Consulting and understanding needs play a significant role.
In addition, thanks to our own 'Onboarding Selection' service, we support and ensure the best possible integration of candidates into the company. We are both recruitment consultants and integration coaches.
The onboarding process is not just about post-selection follow-up; it accompanies the entire process from the very beginning, always aligned with the company's mission and goals.
Each recruitment process is unique because no two people or companies are the same. There is a solution for every company, and at Sandra Roggero Consulting, we know how to find it.`;
